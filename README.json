1. Replication provides a level of fault tolerance against the loss of a single database server
2. Replication can provide increased read capacity as clients can send read operations to different servers.
3. A replica set contains several data bearing nodes minimum2 nodes including primary
4. Different type of nodes exist in replica set
4.1. Regular node OR data bearing nodes (PRIMARY or SECONDARY)
	    Which hold copies of the replica set’s data and can accept read operations from client applications
        4.2. Arbiter node.
	    If you have a even set of replicaSet nodes so you need to have a majority to vote primary node.
		It can participate in voting
        4.3. Delayed node or Disaster recovery node 
	    It can be set an hour or2 behind then the other nodes
		It can participate in voting
		It cannot become elected as a primary node ever(priority0).
        4.4. Hidden node
	    present for the purposes of Analytics, Recovery
		It cannot become elected as a primary node ever(priority0).
5. By default all reads and writes goes to primary (High consistency)
   We can allow user to read data from secondary but this might happen that the data is stall ..
    a behind the primary lates data (consistency decreases).
   The replication of data from primary to secondary is asynchronous so we cannot tell exact time required
    for it.
   Read preferences can be set in drivers whether not to execept reads from secondary.
6. When failover occurs then during the process of electing primary no writes are completed as
 there is no primary (write failure condition)
7. Eventual consistency is a term that in mongo cluster eventually after some time every secondary
 node will get the data written on primary.
   Eventual consistency in mongodb is only when we allow reads from secondary otherwise consistency is100% if read and writes are from primary only.
8. Lets create a basic replicaSet 
   1. Create a  create_replica_set.sh
        mkdir -p /data/rs1 /data/rs2 /data/rs3
        mongod --replSet rs1 --logpath"1.log" --dbpath /data/rs1 --port27018 --fork
        mongod --replSet rs1 --logpath"2.log" --dbpath /data/rs2 --port27019 --fork
        mongod --replSet rs1 --logpath"3.log" --dbpath /data/rs3 --port27020 --fork
   2. bash	< create_replica_set.sh	  
   O/p
        ubuntualok@ubuntualokVirtualBox:~/Desktop/MongoReplication$ sudo bash create_replica_set.sh 
        about to fork child process, waiting until server is ready for connections.
        forked process: 29975
        ERROR: child process failed, exited with error number48
        about to fork child process, waiting until server is ready for connections.
        forked process: 29981
        child process started successfully, parent exiting
        about to fork child process, waiting until server is ready for connections.
        forked process: 30008
        child process started successfully, parent exiting
    4. update DNS of our local
        ubuntualok@ubuntualokVirtualBox:~/Desktop/MongoReplication$ cat /etc/hosts127.0.0.1	localhost127.0.1.1	ubuntualokVirtualBox127.0.0.1   alokadhao.com

9. Initiate replicaSet
        By this we have all3 servers running but not yet initialized and they dont know about each other yet 
        for this we have to create a configuration

        Create init_replica.js

		rs.initiate is a mongo command

        IMPORTANT: you cannot rs.initiate(config) from the host which cannot be a primary that is priority: 0 so always run this command or script from 
                primary capable hosts

    COMMAND - ubuntualok@ubuntualokVirtualBox:~/Desktop/MongoReplication$ mongo --port27019 < init_replica.js
    O/P - init_replica_op.json

10. Let try to connect one of the node of replicaSet
        COMMAND - ubuntualok@ubuntualokVirtualBox:~/Desktop/MongoReplication$ mongo --port27019
        O/p rs1:PRIMARY> 
            This is telling me that I am connected to one of the replicaSet node which is a Primary node 
        COMMAND - rs1:PRIMARY> rs.status()
        O/p - 10.rs.status1.json 
            We can see3 replicaSet node details2 are secondary and1 is primary    
11. Lets try to insert to primary 
        COMMAND - rs1:PRIMARY> db.people.insert({'name':'Alok Adhao'
})
        O/P     - WriteResult({
    "nInserted": 1
})

12. Lets try reading same data through secondary
        COMMAND - mongo --port 27020
        1.  COMMAND - rs1:SECONDARY> db.people.find()
            O/p Error: error: {
                "ok": 0,
                "errmsg": "not master and slaveOk=false",
                "code": 13435,
                "codeName": "NotMasterNoSlaveOk"
            }
        To resolve this 
        2.  COMMAND - rs.slaveOk()
            O/p Done
        3.  COMMAND - rs1:SECONDARY> db.people.find()
            O/p -   { "_id" : ObjectId("591d4122a8d0b2c712412f07"), "name" : "Alok Adhao" }
        
        4. Same for other secondary
            COMMAND mongo --port 27018
            COMMAND - rs.slaveOk()
            db.people.find()
            O/P     { "_id" : ObjectId("591d4122a8d0b2c712412f07"), "name" : "Alok Adhao" }

13. Check if the mongo node is master or not 
        1. On secondary - 
            COMMAND - mongo --port 27020
            COMMAND - rs1:SECONDARY> rs.isMaster()
            O/p - 13.rs.isMaster-op.json
        2. On Primary - 
            Command - mongo --port 27019
            O/p 13.rs.isMaster-op-2.json
            
14. So How does replication works? -> oplogs
    COMMAND rs1:PRIMARY> db.people.insert({"name":"Pankaj"});
    1. On primary there is a capped collection(of certain size and it will loop after it fills) in "local" db which contains an oplog 
     db.oplog.rs.find().pretty()
     O/p one of the from complete collection
       {
            "ts" : Timestamp(1495093631, 1),
            "t" : NumberLong(1),
            "h" : NumberLong("7084982797128653433"),
            "v" : 2,
            "op" : "i",
            "ns" : "test.people",
            "o" : {
                "_id" : ObjectId("591d517f06a0a89193769f30"),
                "name" : "Pankaj"
            }
        }
    2. On Secondory as well there is a capped collection with same name 
    db.oplog.rs.find().pretty()
    {
        "ts" : Timestamp(1495093631, 1),
        "t" : NumberLong(1),
        "h" : NumberLong(7084982797128653433),
        "v" : 2,
        "op" : "i",
        "ns" : "test.people",
        "o" : {
            "_id" : ObjectId("591d517f06a0a89193769f30"),
            "name" : "Pankaj"
        }
    }
    3. SO, Every secondary itteratively ask to primary if there is any new update after a perticuar timestamp ts.
    4. Same process works if we create index on primary as well 

15. On Primary failover
    1. ubuntualok@ubuntualokVirtualBox:/data$ ps -ef | grep mongo
    O/p ubuntua+ 29352  1918  1 10:56 ?        00:01:49 /home/ubuntualok/Downloads/robomongo-1.0.0-linux-x86_64-89f24ea/bin/robomongo
        root     30253  1918  0 11:25 ?        00:00:55 mongod --replSet rs1 --logpath log/1.log --dbpath /data/rs1 --port 27018 --fork
        root     30287  1918  0 11:25 ?        00:00:55 mongod --replSet rs1 --logpath log/2.log --dbpath /data/rs2 --port 27019 --fork
        root     30380  1918  0 11:26 ?        00:00:54 mongod --replSet rs1 --logpath log/3.log --dbpath /data/rs3 --port 27020 --fork
        Before killing primary 
    rs.status()
    O/p
    15-beforeKillingMaster.json
    2. killing primary 
        ubuntualok@ubuntualokVirtualBox:/data$ sudo kill 30287
    3. after killing primary (3 sec after)
        rs.status()
        O/p 15-afterKillingPrimary.json


16. Implication of replication - 
    1. Seed list (Driver should always know members of the replicaSets)
    2. Write concern (w: waiting for some nodes to acknowledge ) 
                     (j: wait or not wait to commit there writes to disk on primary node<not to be on journel>)
                     (wtimeout: wait time until to other nodes are done writing)
    3. Read perference - (only from primary)(still data may be from secondary).
    4. Error can happen.


17. Communation with node.js 
    1. Driver itself tracks about which nodes are up and reconnection and checking which node is primary
    2. While connection to replica set 
        1. We can give commma seprated list of all the hosts and ports
        2. Or we can give only one host and port and the driver will get all other node details if the node is in replica set
        3. If we have given only 1 member and it is down then it wont be able to find rest of the nodes hence its is a good
         practice to always give list of nodes instade of only one
        is case of one of it is missing then it will be searched by the driver.
    3. To add new replica set a new node 
        COMMAND: rs.add("ipaddress:port");
    4. Syntax to connect to replicaset is in server.js in Server folder

18. FailOver
    1. SO when primary is down, Driver sence the same and buffer the writes in driver untill failover completes
    Code to check this behaviour - 

    Server/checkingFailover.js
    
     In this we are inserting record every one second and failing over the primary manually and checing its behaviour, It works as 
    expected.

19. Write councern
    1. w:1 -> this mins send write to primary and once primary acknowledges the write then response back to user
    2. w:0 -> we are not councern about acknowledgement, In this case driver imidiately returns success once it is sent out to insert.
    3. w:2 -> this retruns write successfull when 1 primary and atleast one secondary write to disk is compelted.
    4. w:3 -> same goes with 3 that 1 primary and atleast 2 secondary should be done writing success.
    5. w:'j' -> write to primary journel before you retrun success.
    6. w:'majority' -> this means majority of nodes should have written data to disk before written success to user
    7. We can prvide this options on 2 levels
        1. global level that is in mongodb Connection url string
        2. during db.insert call giving 2nd parameter as {'w': 2}
        Eg given in Server/writeConcern.js
    8. If we set w= number which is more than number of nodes then driver will not raise any error but the write operation waits forever.

20. Read preference.
    1. Bydefault all reads from driver will go to primary
    2. there are following types of read preferences
        1. Primary only
        2. secondary only
        3. primary perfered
        4. secondary prefered
        5. Nearest
    3. We can provide read preference on 2 levels 
        1. global level that is in mongodb Connection url string - ?readPreference=secondary
        2. during db.find method as second parameter -> {'readPreference': ReadPreference.PRIMARY}
    4. Eg. given in Server/readPreference.js
