secondary       - priority1     voting

Delayed node    - priority0     voting
Hidden node     - priority0     voting

So How does replication works? -> oplogs local.oplog.rs

Write concern   
1. w:1 -> this mins send write to primary and once primary acknowledges the write then response back to user
2. w:0 -> we are not councern about acknowledgement, In this case driver imidiately returns success once it is sent out to insert.
3. w:2 -> this retruns write successfull when 1 primary and atleast one secondary write to disk is compelted.
4. w:3 -> same goes with 3 that 1 primary and atleast 2 secondary should be done writing success.
5. w:'j' -> write to primary journel before you retrun success.
6. w:'majority' -> this means majority of nodes should have written data to disk before written success to user

Read perference - (only from primary)(still data may be from secondary).
1. Primary only
2. secondary only
3. primary perfered
4. secondary prefered
5. Nearest

Driver itself tracks about which nodes are up and reconnection and checking which node is primary

FailOver
    1. SO when primary is down, Driver sence the same and buffer the writes in driver untill failover completes

Replica set can have up to50 members, but only7 voting members

Non-Voting Members - hold copies of the replica setâ€™s data and can accept read operations from client applications.
